Notes:
I couldn't get the error to display on the index.jsp. I tried to play 
around with the coding both on the index.jsp (<c:out value = "${ContactServlet.error}"/> and
I tried <c:out value = "${error}"/> as well as ${error} etc etc. Additionally,
I tried to add the error as a global value in ConstactServlet, tried putting print
statements around to test where the scope was, etc. And once I got the scope 
to where I thought it was ok, it still wasn't printing. So, I had to abandon it after
spending a few hours trying to figure it out. I would appreciate learning though as
I do want to know. I did ask on Thursday evening and we both thought it should work
but it wasn't.
